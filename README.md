# Lower_Upper_functions
Lower and upper functions as approximations for positive non-zero valued functions. It demonstrates a method from [1], i.e., a use of Lower and Upper (LU) bounding functions with specific components. In Github repository ZahraAlijani/UpperLowerApp LU functions are used for approximating solutions to differential equations under uncertainty. A generalization to higher-dimensional case is in progress.

It contains Ipython notebook: 
`lower_upper_functions_experiments.ipynb`

## `lower_upper_functions_experiments.ipynb` 
This notebook contains examples of fuzzy sets and numbers. Some practical challenges are included with the solution to overcome them. In the following list are the most important functions included in the notebook:
- `f_A_down(x)` - function doing lower approximation.
- `f_A_up(x)`- function doing lower approximation.
